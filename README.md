# tagzen

An api microservice to tag and catagorise tv & movies at ease

## Running

Clone then build with `cargo build --release`. The outputted binary from this will be outputted inside of `target/release` which can be optionally stripped and ran as a static binary. All help infomation is contained inside of the api itself, so just visit the index page once it's up and running 👐
